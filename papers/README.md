### Graph Signal Processing

| Paper Name | Description | Link |
|------------|-------------|------|
| **Graph Signal Processing, Graph Neural Network and Graph Learning on Biological Data: A Systematic Review** | This paper provides a systematic review of graph-based methods such as Graph Signal Processing (GSP), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and graph topology inference. It focuses on their algorithms and applications to biological data, offering insights for future research. | [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9585532) |
| **Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models** |This paper addresses the challenges of modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate biosignals by representing them as time-dependent graphs. It introduces GraphS4mer, a GNN architecture leveraging Structured State Space architecture and graph structure learning to improve biosignal classification tasks. The model shows improvements in tasks like seizure detection, sleep staging, and ECG classification.|[PDF](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v209/tang23a/tang23a.pdf). |
|**A Novel Automated Tower Graph Based ECG Signal Classification Method with Hexadecimal Local Adaptive Binary Pattern and Deep Learning**|This paper proposes a novel ECG signal classification method using a tower graph transformation and a new one-dimensional hexadecimal pattern. The method involves feature extraction with a hexadecimal local adaptive binary pattern and feature selection using iterative ReliefF and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA). The approach achieves high classification accuracy with 95.70% and 97.10% using artificial and deep neural networks, respectively.|[Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12652-021-03324-4.pdf) |
