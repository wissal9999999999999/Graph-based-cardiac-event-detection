**Abstract:**  
Graph-structured data is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social sciences, from telecommunication networks to quantum chemistry. Building relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures is crucial if we want systems that can learn, reason, and generalize from this kind of data. Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representation learning, including techniques for deep graph embeddings, generalizations of convolutional neural networks to graph-structured data, and neural message-passing approaches inspired by belief propagation. These advances in graph representation learning have led to new state-of-the-art results in numerous domains, including chemical synthesis, 3D-vision, recommender systems, question answering, and social network analysis.

The goal of this book is to provide a synthesis and overview of graph representation learning. We begin with a discussion of the goals of graph representation learning, as well as key methodological foundations in graph theory and network analysis. Following this, we introduce and review methods for learning node embeddings, including random-walk based methods and applications to knowledge graphs. We then provide a technical synthesis and introduction to the highly successful graph neural network (GNN) formalism, which has become a dominant and fast-growing paradigm for deep learning with graph data. The book concludes with a synthesis of recent advancements in deep generative models for graphs—a nascent, but quickly growing subset of graph representation learning.

### Introduction to Graph Signal Processing

To understand graph signal processing, you should read this book:

**Introduction to Graph Signal Processing**  
Ljubiša Stanković, Miloš Daković, and Ervin Sejdić

**Abstract:**  
Graph signal processing deals with signals whose domain, defined by a graph, is irregular. An overview of basic graph forms and definitions is presented first. Spectral analysis of graphs is discussed next. Some simple forms of processing signal on graphs, like filtering in the vertex and spectral domain, subsampling and interpolation, are given. Graph topologies are reviewed and analyzed as well. Theory is illustrated through examples, including a few applications at the end of the chapter.
